# Occultation Timing Android App

An Android application designed for timing and recording occultation and eclipsing events in astronomical observations.
Developed in Java with XML-based UI layouts.

# Overview

This app assists astronomers in accurately recording the time of occultations and eclipsing events using GPS-based timing and audio recording. It provides an integrated workflow for both observation and data submission.

# Features

GPS-Based Time Acquisition
Automatically retrieves and displays accurate observation time from the deviceâ€™s GPS module.

Audio Recording
Records the observerâ€™s voice during the event for synchronization and verification purposes.

Observation Form
After recording, the observer completes a standard observation report form within the app.

PDF Report Generation
The completed form is automatically converted into a PDF file, ready for submission.

Data Sharing
The report can be sent directly to the International Occultation and Timing Association (IOTA) and other astronomy communities.

# Usage
Open the app and enable GPS.
Start audio recording before the occultation event begins.
Once the event is over, fill out the observation form.
Export the PDF report and share it with your local or international astronomy organization.

#Purpose

This app was created to improve the accuracy and standardization of occultation timing data collected by amateur astronomers worldwide. It streamlines the reporting process and ensures compatibility with global databases.

# Author

Developed by Zeinab S L., based on her previous collaboration with IOTA/ME (International Occultation and Timing Association â€“ Middle East), focusing on tools for precision timing in astronomical observations.
