# SkyTiming

An Android application designed for precise timing of astronomical occultation and eclipsing events.

# Overview

SkyTiming is a portable, automated tool for astronomers and observers to accurately record event timings using mobile devices.
It provides an integrated workflow for both observation and data submission. It synchronizes time via GPS, records observer voice, and generates a standardized observation report in PDF format for submission to international databases.

# Features

* GPS-Based Time Acquisition
Automatically retrieves and displays accurate observation time from the device‚Äôs GPS module.

* Audio Recording
Records the observer‚Äôs voice during the event for synchronization and verification purposes.

* Observation Form
After recording, the observer completes a standard observation report form within the app.

* PDF Report Generation
The completed form is automatically converted into a PDF file, ready for submission.

* Data Sharing
The report can be sent directly to the International Occultation and Timing Association (IOTA) and other astronomy communities.

# Usage
+ Open the app and enable GPS.
+ Start audio recording before the occultation event begins.
+ Once the event is over, fill out the observation form.
+ Export the PDF report and share it with your local or international astronomy organization.

# Purpose

This app was created to improve the accuracy and standardization of occultation timing data collected by amateur astronomers worldwide. It streamlines the reporting process and ensures compatibility with global databases.
